abstract = {We present a new fast multipole method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We employ both distributed memory parallelism (via MPI) and shared memory parallelism (via OpenMP and GPU acceleration) to rapidly evaluate two-body nonoscillatory potentials in three dimensions on heterogeneous high performance computing architectures. We have performed scalability tests with up to 30 billion particles on 196,608 cores on the AMD/ CRAY-based Jaguar system at ORNL. On a GPU-enabled system (NSF's Keeneland at Georgia Tech/ORNL), we observed 30× speedup over a single core CPU and 7× speedup over a multicore CPU implementation. By combining GPUs with MPI, we achieve less than 10 ns/particle and six digits of accuracy for a run with 48 million nonuniformly distributed particles on 192 GPUs. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

@article{Malhotra2015,
abstract = {We describe our implementation of a parallel fast multipole method for evaluating potentials for discrete and continuous source distributions. The first requires summation over the source points and the second requiring integration over a continuous source density. Both problems require O(N 2) complexity when computed directly ; however, can be accelerated to O(N) time using FMM. In our PVFMM software library, we use kernel independent FMM and this allows us to compute potentials for a wide range of elliptic kernels. Our method is high order, adaptive and scalable. In this paper, we discuss several algorithmic improvements and performance optimizations including cache locality, vectorization, shared memory parallelism and use of coprocessors. Our distributed memory implementation uses space-filling curve for partitioning data and a hypercube communication scheme. We present convergence results for Laplace, Stokes and Helmholtz (low wavenumber) kernels for both particle and volume FMM. We measure efficiency of our method in terms of CPU cycles per unknown for different accuracies and different kernels. We also demonstrate scala-bility of our implementation up to several thousand processor cores on the Stampede platform at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.},

@article{Engquist2007,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new directional multilevel algorithm for solving N-body or AT-point problems with highly oscillatory kernels. These systems often result from the boundary integral formulations of scattering problems and are difficult due to the oscillatory nature of the kernel and the non-uniformity of the particle distribution. We address the problem by first proving that the interaction between a ball of radius r and a well-separated region has an approximate low rank representation, as long as the well-separated region belongs to a cone with a spanning angle of O(1/r) and is at a distance which is at least O(r2) away from from the ball. We then propose an efficient and accurate procedure which utilizes random sampling to generate such a separated, low rank representation. Based on the resulting representations, our new algorithm organizes the high frequency far field computation by a multidirectional and multiscale strategy to achieve maximum efficiency. The algorithm performs well on a large group of highly oscillatory kernels. Our algorithm is proved to have O(N log N) computational complexity for any given accuracy when the points are sampled from a two dimensional surface. We also provide numerical results to demonstrate these properties. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {A new O (N) fast multipole formulation is proposed for non-oscillatory kernels. This algorithm is applicable to kernels K (x, y) which are only known numerically, that is their numerical value can be obtained for any (x, y). This is quite different from many fast multipole methods which depend on analytical expansions of the far-field behavior of K, for | x - y | large. Other "black-box" or "kernel-independent" fast multipole methods have been devised. Our approach has the advantage of requiring a small pre-computation time even for very large systems, and uses the minimal number of coefficients to represent the far-field, for a given L2 tolerance error in the approximation. This technique can be very useful for problems where the kernel is known analytically but is quite complicated, or for kernels which are defined purely numerically. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Martinsson2007,
abstract = {A version of the fast multipole method (FMM) is described for charge distributions on the line. Previously published schemes of this type relied either on analytical representations of the potentials to be evaluated (multipoles, Legendre expansions, Taylor series, etc.) or on tailored representations that were constructed numerically (using, e.g., the singular value decomposition (SVD), artificial charges, etc.). The algorithm of this paper belongs to the second category, utilizing the matrix compression scheme described in [H. Cheng, Z. Gimbutas, P. G. Martinsson, and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 26 (2005), pp. 1389-1404]. The resulting scheme exhibits substantial improvements in the CPU time requirements. Furthermore, the scheme is applicable to a wide variety of potentials; in this respect, it is similar to the SVD-based FMMs. The performance of the method is illustrated with several numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},
